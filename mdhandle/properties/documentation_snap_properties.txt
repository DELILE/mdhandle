documentation_snap_properties --> SnapProperties class

Methods
--------
set_volume(volume)
    Set the volume occupied by the snapshot atoms.
get_volume_density(prop_name)
    Get volume density for general snap property.
get_mass_norm(prop_name)
    Get general snap property normalized by mass.
epair_total(epair_name='epair')
    Calculate total potential energy in snap.
count_total()
    Calculate total number of atoms in snap.
ke_total(ke_name='ke')
    Calculate total kinetic energy in snap from atomwise velocity.
mass_total(mass_name='mass')
    Calculate total mass in snap.
force_total(force_name='force')
    Calculate total force on snap atoms.
other_total(prop_name)
    Calculate total of general property on snap atoms.
com_pos_vel()
