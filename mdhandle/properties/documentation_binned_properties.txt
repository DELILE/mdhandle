Grid Methods
=============

    Methods
    --------
    set_mapping_function(name)
        Sets the mapping function.
    add_new_calc( name, dtype='float', collection_type='scalar',
                                       location='Node', atomwise_name=None)
        Adds metadata for new calculation.
    setup_calculations()
        Perform further setup steps before calling ``run_calc()``.
    change_default_name(calc_name, new_name)
        Change default name for atomwise data used in grid calculation.
    mapping_func()
        Performs mapping from atoms to grid points or cells.
        Must be overridden in sub-classes of :class:`Grid`.

    run_mapping(*args, **kwargs)
        Map atoms to grid according to :meth:`Grid.mapping_func`.
    run_calc()
        Run all gridded calculations as listed in :attr:`Grid.to_calc`.

    _requirements(*list_reqs)
        Check if prerequisite gridded calculations exist, and perform
        necessary calculation if do not yet exist.
    _sum_from_atom_value(atom_value)
        Calculate total of general atomwise property at each grid point
        based on atom-to-grid mapping.  Used to calculate all gridded
        quantities.
    _calc_count()
        Calculate gridded number of atoms.
    _grid_coverage()
        Compare total number of atoms in grid to total number
        of atoms in snapshot.
    _grid_coverage()
        Calculate total number of atoms in grid.
    _calc_num_density()
      Calculate gridded number density.
    _calc_mass()
      Calculate gridded mass.
    _calc_mass_density()
      Calculate gridded mass density.
    _calc_epair_count()
      Calculate gridded pairwise potential energy normalized
      by gridded atom count.
    _calc_coord_count()
      Calcualte gridded coordination number normalized by gridded count.
    _calc_velocity()
      Calculated gridded streaming velocity.
    _calc_ke_count()
      Calculate gridded kinetic energy normalized by gridded count.
    _calc_force_count()
      Calculate gridded net force normalized by gridded count.
    _calc_temp()
      Calculate gridded temperature with streaming correction.
    _calc_temp_uncorr()
      Calculate gridded temperature w/o streaming correction.
    _calc_stress()
        Calculate gridded stress tensor.
