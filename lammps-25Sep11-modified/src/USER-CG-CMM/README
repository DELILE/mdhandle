This package implements 4 commands which can be used in a LAMMPS input
script:

pair_style cg/cmm
pair_style cg/cmm/coul/cut
pair_style cg/cmm/coul/long
angle_style cg/cmm :ul

These styles allow coarse grained MD simulations with the
parametrization of Shinoda, DeVane, Klein, Mol Sim, 33, 27 (2007)
(cg/cmm), with extensions to simulate ionic liquids, electrolytes,
lipids and charged amino acids (to be published soon).

See the doc pages for these commands for details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/cg-cmm.

The current version of this package should be considered beta
quality. The CG potentials work correctly and well, but there will be
optimizations, cleanups and additional tools to aid in setting up and
analyzing simulations with this package added in the next months.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
