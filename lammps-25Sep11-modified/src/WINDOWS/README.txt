INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING LAMMPS WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2005


There are 3 VS projects provided:
LAMMPS.vcproj            -- minimal package set: KSPACE, MANYBODY, MOLECULE
LAMMPS-std.vcproj        -- standard package set (except for REPLICA, REAX, GPU)
LAMMPS-std-user.vcproj   -- standard set with some user packages
 

Each of the projects has configurations to compile either with MPI support or
with MPI stubs.


To compile with MPI:

1.  Install MPICH for Windows, specify the corresponding include 
    and lib directories in MSVS/Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories
2.  Compile LAMMPS using  Debug or Release configurations from the provided projects


To compile with MPI STUBS
   
1.  Compile the STUBS.vcproj 
2.  Compile LAMMPS using  Debug_STUBS or Release_STUBS configurations from the provided projects



To run the code you will need the mpich and fftw213 dlls accessible
by the system search (they may be copied to Windows/system32 directory).
The fftw213 ddlls may be found in vs9/extra/fftw213 or downloaded from the fftw site




To include additional packages into LAMMPS projects, you may follow the pattern of LAMMPS-std-user.vcproj:


1. Add the appropriate *.cpp files to the project (for example to USER-* filter)

2. Add corresponding .h files from the project directory
   to the style_* headers listed in the Settings filter of the project.
   For example, if there is a pair_*.h file in the project directory, it should be added
   to settings/style_pair.h aggregate header.
