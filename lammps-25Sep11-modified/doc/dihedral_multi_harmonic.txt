dihedral_style multi/harmonic command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style multi/harmonic :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style multi/harmonic
dihedral_coeff 1 20 20 20 20 20 :pre

[Description:]

The {multi/harmonic} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_multi_harmonic.jpg)

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

A1 (energy)
A2 (energy)
A3 (energy)
A4 (energy)
A5 (energy) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.

[Default:] none
