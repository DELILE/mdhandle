bond_style harmonic/shift command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style harmonic/shift :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style harmonic/shift
bond_coeff 5 10.0 0.5 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic/shift} bond style is a shifted harmonic bond that uses
the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_harmonic_shift.jpg)

where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance, and rc the critical distance.
The potential is -Umin at r0 and zero at rc. The spring constant is
k = Umin / \[ 2 (r0-rc)^2\].

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

Umin (energy) :ul
r0 (distance) :ul
rc (distance) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info on packages.

[Related commands:]

"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html,
"bond_harmonic"_bond_harmonic.html

[Default:] none
