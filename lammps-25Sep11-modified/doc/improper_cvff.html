<P>where phi is the Wilson out-of-plane angle.

<P>If the 4 atoms in an improper quadruplet (listed in the data file read
by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command) are ordered I,J,K,L then
the Wilson angle is between the plane of I,J,K and the plane of J,K,L.
This is essentially a dihedral angle, which is why the formula for
this improper style is the same as for <A HREF = "dihedral_harmonic.html">dihedral_style
harmonic</A>.  Alternatively, you can think of
atoms J,K,L as being in a plane, and atom I above the plane, and the
Wilson angle as a measure of how far out-of-plane I is with respect to
the other 3 atoms.
</P>
<P>Note that defining 4 atoms to interact in this way, does not mean that
bonds necessarily exist between I-J, J-K, or K-L, as they would in a
linear dihedral.  Normally, the bonds I-J, I-K, I-L would exist for an
improper to be defined between the 4 atoms.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the <A HREF = "improper_coeff.html">improper_coeff</A> command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>

<P>This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
