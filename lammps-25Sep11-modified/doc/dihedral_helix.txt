dihedral_style helix command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style helix :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style helix
dihedral_coeff 1 80.0 100.0 40.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {helix} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_helix.jpg)

This coarse-grain dihedral potential is described in "(Guo)"_#Guo.
For dihedral angles in the helical region, the energy function is
represented by a standard potential consisting of three minima, one
corresponding to the trans (t) state and the other to gauche states
(g+ and g-).  The paper describes how the A,B,C parameters are chosen
so as to balance secondary (largely driven by local interactions) and
tertiary structure (driven by long-range interactions).

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

A (energy)
B (energy)
C (energy) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
