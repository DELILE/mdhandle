<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set parameters used by the kspace solvers defined by the
<A HREF = "kspace_style.html">kspace_style</A> command.  Not all parameters are
relevant to all kspace styles.
</P>
<P>The <I>mesh</I> keyword sets the 3d FFT grid size for kspace style pppm.
Each dimension must be factorizable into powers of 2, 3, and 5.  When
this option is not set, the PPPM solver chooses its own grid size,
consistent with the user-specified accuracy and pairwise cutoff.
Values for x,y,z of 0,0,0 unset the option.
</P>
<P>The <I>order</I> keyword determines how many grid spacings an atom's charge
extends when it is mapped to the FFT grid in kspace style pppm.  The
default for this parameter is 5, which means each charge spans 5 grid
cells in each dimension.  The larger the value of this parameter, the
smaller the FFT grid will need to be to achieve the requested
precision.  Conversely, the smaller the order value, the larger the
grid will be.  Note that there is an inherent trade-off involved: a
small grid will lower the cost of FFTs, but a large order parameter
will increase the cost of intepolating charge/fields to/from the grid.
And vice versa.
</P>
<P>The order parameter may be reset by LAMMPS when it sets up the PPPM
FFT grid if the implied grid stencil extends beyond the grid cells
owned by neighboring processors.  Typically this will only occur when
small problems are run on large numbers of processors.  A warning will
be generated indicating the order parameter is being reduced to allow
LAMMPS to run the problem.
</P>
<P>The <I>gewald</I> keyword sets the value of the Ewald or PPPM G-ewald
parameter.  Without this setting, LAMMPS chooses the parameter
automatically as a function of cutoff, precision, grid spacing, etc.
This means it can vary from one simulation to the next which may not
be desirable for matching a KSpace solver to a pre-tabulated pairwise
potential.  This setting can also be useful if Ewald or PPPM fails to
choose a good grid spacing and G-ewald parameter automatically.  If
the value is set to 0.0, LAMMPS will choose the G-ewald parameter
automatically.
</P>
<P>The <I>slab</I> keyword allows an Ewald or PPPM solver to be used for a
systems that are periodic in x,y but non-periodic in z - a
<A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> setting of "boundary p p f".  This is done by
treating the system as if it were periodic in z, but inserting empty
volume between atom slabs and removing dipole inter-slab interactions
so that slab-slab interactions are effectively turned off.  The
volfactor value sets the ratio of the extended dimension in z divided
by the actual dimension in z.  The recommended value is 3.0.  A larger
value is inefficient; a smaller value introduces unwanted slab-slab
interactions.  The use of fixed boundaries in z means that the user
must prevent particle migration beyond the initial z-bounds, typically
by providing a wall-style fix.  The methodology behind the <I>slab</I>
option is explained in the paper by <A HREF = "#Yeh">(Yeh)</A>.
