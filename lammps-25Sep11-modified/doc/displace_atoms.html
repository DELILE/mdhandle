<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Displace a group of atoms.  This can be used to move atoms a large
distance before beginning a simulation or to randomize atoms initially
on a lattice.  For example, in a shear simulation, an initial strain
can be imposed on the system.  Or two groups of atoms can be brought
into closer proximity.
</P>
<P>The <I>move</I> style displaces the group of atoms by the specified 3d
distance.
</P>
<P>The <I>ramp</I> style displaces atoms a variable amount in one dimension
depending on the atom's coordinate in a (possibly) different
dimension.  For example, the second example command displaces atoms in
the x-direction an amount between 0.0 and 5.0 distance units.  Each
atom's displacement depends on the fractional distance its y
coordinate is between 2.0 and 20.5.  Atoms with y-coordinates outside
those bounds will be moved the minimum (0.0) or maximum (5.0) amount.
</P>
<P>The <I>random</I> style independently moves each atom in the group by a
random displacement, uniformly sampled from a value between -dx and
+dx in the x dimension, and similarly for y and z.  Random numbers are
used in such a way that the displacement of a particular atom is the
same, regardless of how many processors are being used.
</P>
<P>Distance units for displacement are determined by the setting of <I>box</I>
or <I>lattice</I> for the <I>units</I> keyword.  <I>Box</I> means distance units as
defined by the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command - e.g. Angstroms for <I>real</I>
units.  <I>Lattice</I> means distance units are in lattice spacings.  The
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacing.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Care should be taken not to move atoms on top of other atoms.  After
the move, atoms are remapped into the periodic simulation box if
needed.
</P>
<P>Atoms can be moved arbitrarily long distances by this command.  If the
simulation box is non-periodic, this can change its size or shape.
This is not a problem, except that the mapping of processors to the
simulation box is not changed by this command from its initial 3d
configuration; see the <A HREF = "processors.html">processors</A> command.  Thus, if
the box size or shape changes dramatically, the simulation may not be
as well load-balanced (atoms per processor) as the initial mapping
tried to achieve.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command requires inter-processor communication to migrate atoms
once they have been displaced.  This means that your system must be
ready to perform a simulation before using this command (force fields
are setup, atom masses are set, etc).
