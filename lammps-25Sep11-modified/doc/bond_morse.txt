bond_style morse command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style morse :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style morse
bond_coeff 5 1.0 2.0 1.2 :pre

[Description:]

The {morse} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_morse.jpg)

where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance, alpha is a stiffness
parameter, and D determines the depth of the potential well.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

D (energy)
alpha (inverse distance)
r0 (distance) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.

[Related commands:]

"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html

[Default:] none
