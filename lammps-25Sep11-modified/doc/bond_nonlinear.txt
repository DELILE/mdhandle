bond_style nonlinear command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style nonlinear :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style nonlinear
bond_coeff 2 100.0 1.1 1.4 :pre

[Description:]

The {nonlinear} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_nonlinear.jpg)

to define an anharmonic spring "(Rector)"_#Rector of equilibrium
length r0 and maximum extension lamda.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

epsilon (energy)
r0 (distance)
lamda (distance) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.

[Related commands:]

"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html

[Default:] none
