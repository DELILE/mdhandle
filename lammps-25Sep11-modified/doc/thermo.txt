thermo command :h3

[Syntax:]

thermo N :pre

N = output thermodynamics every N timesteps :ul

[Examples:]

thermo 100 :pre

[Description:]

Compute and print thermodynamic info (e.g. temperature, energy,
pressure) on timesteps that are a multiple of N and at the beginning
and end of a simulation.  A value of 0 will only print thermodynamics
at the beginning and end.

The content and format of what is printed is controlled by the
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html and
"thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html commands.

The timesteps on which thermo output is written can also be controlled
by a "variable"_variable.html.  See the "thermo_modify
every"_thermo_modify.html command.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html, "thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html

[Default:]

thermo 0 :pre
