angle_style cosine/periodic command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style cosine/periodic :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style cosine/periodic
angle_coeff * 75.0 1 6 :pre

[Description:]

The {cosine/periodic} angle style uses the following potential, which
is commonly used in the "DREIDING"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 force
field, particularly for organometallic systems where {n} = 4 might be
used for an octahedral complex and {n} = 3 might be used for a
trigonal center:

where C, B and n are coefficients defined for each angle type.

See "(Mayo)"_#Mayo for a description of the DREIDING force field

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

C (energy)
B = 1 or -1
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 for periodicity :ul

Note that the prefactor C is specified and not the overall force
constant K = C / n^2.  When B = 1, it leads to a minimum for the
linear geometry.  When B = -1, it leads to a maximum for the linear
geometry.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.

[Default:] none
